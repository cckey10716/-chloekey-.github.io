	<p>My name is Chloe Key. I am currently a freshman at the University of Georgia and I am an intended Finance major. I have not always lived in Georgia, however. I am from Bowling Green, Kentucky which is about six hours away from Athens. I enjoy living in Athens, but I miss my family because they are so far away. I have an older sister who is 20, she attends the University of Lousiville, and I have two younger brothers, one is 15 and one is 17. My brothers both live at home with my parents. I also have a golden doodle named Copley.</p>
	<p>I am a member of the Alpha Delta Pi Sorority at the University of Georgia. I enjoy being in a sorority because I am able to build new friendships as well as helping out in the community. Every sorority has a philanthropy that they raise money for and Alpha Delta Pi's is The Ronald McDonald House.</p>

	<p>My name is Chloe Key. I am currently a freshman at the University of Georgia and I am an intended Finance major. I am originally from Bowling Green, Kentucky, which is about six hours away from Athens and a relatively small town in comparison.I have an older sister who is 20, Lucy, who attends the University of Lousiville, and I have two younger brothers, Brady who is 15 and Charlie who is 17. I also have a golden doodle named Copley. I enjoy living in Athens and everything that it has to offer, however I always miss my family.</p>
	<p>My everyday schedule in college is very busy. I have 2-4 classes every day--Wednesday's being my busiest day. After my classes are over for the day, I typically either go home and take a nap or I will go the the MLC to work on homework. The amount of time I spend at the MLC each week depends on what work I have, but some weeks I am there up to 18 hours. After my studying is done for the day, I go to the gym at the Ramsey Student Center if I have enough time. My goal is to make it to the gym at least three times a week--however, that rarely happens.</p> 
	<p>Another activity that is included in my schedule each week is my weekly sorority chapter meeting. I am a member of Alpha Delta Pi at the University of Georgia. In our weekly chapter meetings on Mondays, we discuss everything going on within our chapter for that specific week. However, there are several days besides Mondays that we convene as a group. Those days are when we are putting on philanthropy events. Every sorority or fraternity has a philanthropy that they work to raise money for. Alpha Delta Pi's is The Ronald McDonald House and so throughout the semester we put on events to raise money for them. Below, I included an example of what my weekly schedule typically looks like. </p>

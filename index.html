<h1 style="text-align:center"> Chloe Key</h1>
	<p>My name is Chloe Key. I am currently a freshman at the University of Georgia and I am an intended Finance major. I have not always lived in Georgia, however. I am from Bowling Green, Kentucky which is about six hours away from Athens. I enjoy living in Athens, but I miss my family because they are so far away.

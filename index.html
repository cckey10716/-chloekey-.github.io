	<p>My name is Chloe Key. I am currently a freshman at the University of Georgia and I am an intended Finance major. I am originally from Bowling Green, Kentucky.I have an older sister who is 20, she attends the University of Lousiville, and I have two younger brothers, one is 15 and one is 17. I also have a golden doodle named Copley.</p>
	<p>My everyday schedule in college is very busy. I have 2-4 classes every day--Wednesday's being my busiest day. After my classes are over for the day, I typically either go home and take a nap or I will go the the MLC to work on homework. The amount of time I spend at the MLC each week depends on what work I have, but some weeks I am there up to 18 hours. After my studying is done for the day, I go to the gym at the Ramsey Student Center if I have enough time. Another activity that is included in my schedule each week is my weekly sorority chapter meeting. I am a member of Alpha Delta Pi at the University of Georgia. Below, I included an example of what my weekly schedule typically looks like. </p>
